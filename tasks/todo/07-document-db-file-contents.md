# Task 7: Document which .db files contain which data

## Goal

Document the purpose and contents of each `.db` file in the project so developers can quickly understand what lives where.

## Details

- Identify all `.db` / SQLite files the project creates or uses
- For each file, document: tables, what data they hold, when they're created/populated, and how they relate to each other
- Include the HTTP cache database if it exists as a separate file
- Note which files are safe to delete vs which contain irreplaceable data
